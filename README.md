## Hello there :milky_way:

### :alien: I’m currently working on my NodeJS backend (design patterns, good practices, unit tests and communications using Web Sockets) and Blockchain (more like learning the basics: understanding cryptography, p2p protocol, mining a blockchain, consent protocols and beyond)
### 🧠 I'm currently learning better ways to structure my code. I also practice my Javascript daily and learning more about Blockchain.
### :octocat: I'm looking to collaborate on javascript implementations and Blockchain, I would prefer find a Blockchain project than a purple horn unicorn :unicorn: :thinking:
### :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me: I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold. :movie_camera: :vhs: 🦇☎️
