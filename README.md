# Hello there :milky_way:

#### :alien: I’m currently working on Javascript/Typescript and searching knowledge in Blockchain, I'm currently seeking enough knowledge to build a simple Blockchain from scratch. 🤔
#### 🧠 I'm currently learning better ways to structure my code. I also practice my Javascript daily in my work and learning more about Blockchain, especially peer to peer protocols.
#### :octocat: I'm looking to collaborate on Blockchain technology, I would prefer find a Blockchain project than a purple horn unicorn :unicorn: :thinking:
#### :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me: I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold. :movie_camera: :vhs: 🦇☎️
